This project demonstrates how to centralize the Oauth2 Authorization Server process for approving or granting access to any application.
It functions as a service similar to Facebook's SingIn and Google's Sign-in. We can achieve our unique feature of granting the user access 
to specific registered clients (applications) so they may utilize them by using the Oauth2 Authorization server.
